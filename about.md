I write for fun. Interested in global economic and tech policy, while dabbling a bit in investing. Don't know what I want to focus on yet, but will figure that out as I write more.

### Who's Grant

Graduated from UC Berkeley's EECS dept. in 2020. Work as a Scientific Advisor at Perkins Coie LLP in their intellectual property and technology practice group. My thoughts are independent of my firm.
